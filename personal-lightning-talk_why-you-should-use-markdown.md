##### What are some benefits of using Markdown?
- plain text is future-proof
    - as long as there are computers that can read text files, you will be able to read Markdown files
- no need to rely on specialized, closed-source formats in an app that may be discontinued or abandoned later on, rendering files in that app effectively useless
- helps reduce distraction; no need for cluttered toolbars & complicated options - just start writing!

##### What are some Markdown use-cases?
- write notes for class
- create to-do lists using checkboxes 
    - `- [ ] this is an unchecked task`
        - [ ] this is an unchecked task
    - `- [x]  this is a checked task`
        - [x] this is a checked task
- Github README files use Markdown for formatting
- Use Markdown to write content that gets converted into HTML for a website with a tool like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
