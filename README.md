# Ada Lightning Talks

This repository holds the presentations for my lightning talks at Ada Developer's Academy.

To view the talks as a set of slides, open up the repository as a vault in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/),
enable the [Slides plugin](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Slides),
and start the presentation.

To add the intended styling, go into Settings --> Appearance and add the slides.css file as a [CSS Snippet](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Add+custom+styles).
